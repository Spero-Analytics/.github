## 🌱 Our Mission

Methane is one of the most powerful greenhouse gases, yet it remains challenging to measure accurately and continuously. Our mission is to make methane monitoring **simple, reliable, and scalable**, so that organizations can take immediate and informed action to reduce emissions.

---

## 🔍 What We Do

We design and deploy **wireless sensor networks** that continuously monitor methane emissions across large, remote sites such as landfills and oil & gas facilities.  
Each sensor node measures methane concentration, temperature, and humidity, and communicates through a **long-range wireless mesh network**.  
The data is analyzed in real time to provide **insightful, site-wide emission maps** and performance metrics.

Our technology brings together:
- **Smart, low-power hardware** designed for harsh field environments  
- **Cloud-based data analytics** powered by machine learning  
- **User-friendly dashboards** for continuous visualization and reporting

## 🧩 Why It Matters

Accurate, continuous data helps organizations:
- Detect leaks early and prioritize maintenance  
- Quantify real emissions instead of relying on estimates  
- Demonstrate measurable progress toward climate goals

## 🏗️ Where We Work

Our systems have been **deployed at multiple Canadian landfills** and developed in collaboration with partners such as **Environment and Climate Change Canada** and **Carleton University**.  
We’re proud recipients of the **Connaught Innovation Award**, **RBC Momentum Award**, and **Desjardins Startup Prize**, recognizing our innovation and impact in methane monitoring.
